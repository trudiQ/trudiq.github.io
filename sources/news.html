        <div class="news-content">My research lab's recent work on AI-assisted VR modeling 
            has been accepted to IEEE AIxVR 2026 held in Osaka Japan this January. 
            We propose a new method to turn noisy, hand-sculpted voxel data into clean 
            3D geometry, moving us closer to seamless rapid prototyping in immersive environments.</div>
